# Week 2 Project:


This week's project is to build a website with correct repsonsive layout _in small steps_!  Your web page will be larger and more complex than the last project, but you will have [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm6CUkswsNw) for support. Mr. Traversy is one of the best coaches on YouTube so you're in good hands.

But wait.  A working website is not a finished project!

The true focus of this week's project is to practice breaking websites down into small steps. If you are still not fully confident in your HTML/CSS skills, that's fine!  Feel free to use the exact code you wrote while following the tutorial.  You will learn an enormous amout about HTML & CSS by breaking your finished code into smaller (working!) projects.

If you want to push your HTML & CSS to the next level, go for it!  As long as your project is broken into smaller pieces, feel free to elaborate on each step or even to add new steps at the end. 

Feeling very ambitious?  Start a whole new project from scratch!

## What will we be checking for?

We still expect your Week 2 project to be broken down into working steps with a table in the ```index.html``` to describe your user stories, and for each step to be saved separately in it's own folder.  Only this time we don't tell you what the steps are!  

Part of your assignment is to decide when one user story begins and the next ends.  (We won't even tell you how many user stories there are ;) You'll get a chance in class next Sunday to discuss the different ways this project an be broken down into user stories.

> No matter how wonderful and responsive your website is, it's still not complete unless it's broken into steps.
