## Replicate [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)

This week's project is to build your own copy of the DuckDuckGo home page (See the assignment table [live on GitHub Pages](https://be-hacking-hyf.github.io/HTML-CSS-GitHub/homework/week-3-project/)).  We don't expect it to be identical if we open the inspector, but visually it should be as close as possible.  This week's project will be a good chance to practice [Inspecting the DOM](http://hackyourfuture.be/inspecting-the-dom/),  Here's some helpful articles:
* [Finding which colors a website uses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Inspect_and_select_colors)
* [Which fonts a website uses](https://wpshout.com/quick-guides/how-to-see-what-fonts-a-website-is-using/)
* [Which images a website uses](https://www.lifewire.com/copy-image-web-address-url-1174175)


As in the last weeks, you should also practice _incremental development_.  Turning your homework in using one folder per step is enough, but if you're looking for a challenge ... [Build With Branches](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/built-with-branches)!  

To push yourself to the next level, give a shot at using branches and clearly labeled commits to organize your development.  In the last weeks you had one folder per step.  Using git you'll have one branch per step, when the step is complete you will merge your changes to ```master``` and start a new branch for the new step.  

To see what a finished project would look like, clone [Built with Branches](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/built-with-branches) and study it in GitKraken & VSC.  Try checking out a commit, looking in your editor, and opening ```index.html``` in the browser.

For more info on how to study Built with Branches you can revise the [week 3 lesson plan](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/HTML-CSS-GitHub/wiki/Lesson-Plan-wk-3#developing-with-branches).
